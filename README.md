### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Max Lepper, and I am an aspiring front-end web developer from Dayton, Ohio. I am currently devoting most of my time outside of work to web projects and learning.

### ðŸ’» My Sites

- Learning Log â†’ <https://maxlepper.gitlab.io/learning-log/>

Learning Log is my daily tracker for web development logs, with statistics about how I am spending my time, what I am working on, reflections and notes from what I have learned, and what I have planned next.

- My Portfolio â†’ <https://maxlepper.me/>

My portfolio is currently under construction, as my primary focus has been Learning Log and building a strong learning foundation.
